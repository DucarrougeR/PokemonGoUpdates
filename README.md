# PokemonGoUpdates
##### no affiliation with Niantic, Inc 

A Python 3 based add-on for mobile game Pokemon Go.

## Update
No longer operative due to changes in API setup and Terms & Conditions from Niantic.

### Why?
Various third party applications provide geo-location of Pokemons when these are run local machines. Unfortunately, one cannot conveniently carry and use his/her local machine and adventure through the city with their phone to play the game.

### Concept
Use this light-weight add-on to open a browser showing the Pokemon map.
Take a screenshot and save the image.
Send the map with pokemons to an email address to catch them all.

Currently the add-on works with an online map, but was intended to be deployed on the local machine's application. 

### Technologies
